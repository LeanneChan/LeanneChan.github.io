## Data Science Portfolio 

Hi! I am Leanne. This is a collection of the work I have done so far. The geospatial data science projects here were done while I was a graduate under the MUSA programme at the University of Pennsylvania. I am very grateful for all the guidance and teaching from the professors in MUSA. I have since graduated and hope to continue adding to this collection!
