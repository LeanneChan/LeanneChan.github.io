## Data Science Portfolio 

Hi! I am Leanne. This is a collection of the projects I have worked on so far. A lot of the geospatial data science projects here were completed as part of the MUSA programme at the University of Pennsylvania, where I recieved my Masters. I am very grateful for the Professors in MUSA for their guidance and teaching. I have since graduated and hope to continue adding to this collection!
